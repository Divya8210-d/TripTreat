# Trip&Treat

"Trip and Treat" is a thoughtfully designed web application inspired by the Airbnb-style booking experience, offering a seamless way to discover and book homestays. What sets it apart is its unique twist - it not only showcases beautiful homestays but also integrates nearby tourist attractions and local eateries, helping travelers make the most of their stay.

Currently focused on Northeast India, especially Manipur, this platform is your gateway to exploring hidden gems, local delicacies, and cultural hotspots - all within reach of your chosen accommodation. Whether you're an adventurer, a foodie, or a casual explorer, Trip and Treat offers personalized recommendations, curated travel guides, and community-driven reviews to enrich your journey.

With a humble aim to promote local experiences and connect travelers with authentic destinations, Trip and Treat is here to help you explore more, taste more, and experience more - one trip at a time.
